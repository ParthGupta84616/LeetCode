# Problem Description:
The code counts the number of subarrays of size 3 in the array `nums` where the middle element is the average of the first and last elements of the subarray.

# Algorithm:
1. Iterate through the array starting from the second element and ending at the second-to-last element.
2. For each element, check if it satisfies the condition `(nums[i - 1] + nums[i + 1]) * 2 == nums[i]`.
3. If the condition is satisfied, increment the `count`.
4. Return the `count` as the result.

# Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs in O(n), where `n` is the size of the array. This is because it iterates through the array once.

# Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses O(1) additional space as it only uses a single integer variable for computation.

# Edge Cases:
1. An array with fewer than 3 elements will return `0` as no subarray of size 3 exists.
2. An array where no element satisfies the condition will return `0`.

# Example:
Input: nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]  
Output: 3  
Explanation: The subarrays [1, 3, 5], [3, 5, 7], and [5, 7, 9] satisfy the condition.

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Output: 0  
Explanation: No subarray satisfies the condition.
