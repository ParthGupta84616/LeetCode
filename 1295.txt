# Problem Description:
The code counts how many numbers in the array `nums` contain an even number of digits.

# Algorithm:
1. Initialize a counter `evenDigitCount` to `0`.
2. Iterate through each number in the array:
   - Convert the number to a string and calculate its length.
   - If the length is even, increment `evenDigitCount`.
3. Return `evenDigitCount` as the result.

# Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs in O(n * d), where `n` is the size of the array and `d` is the average number of digits in the numbers. This is because converting a number to a string and calculating its length takes O(d) time.

# Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses O(d) additional space for the string representation of each number.

# Edge Cases:
1. If the array is empty, the result is `0`.
2. If all numbers have an odd number of digits, the result is `0`.
3. If all numbers have an even number of digits, the result is the size of the array.

# Example:
Input: nums = [12, 345, 2, 6, 7896]  
Output: 2  
Explanation: 12 and 7896 have an even number of digits.

Input: nums = [555, 901, 482, 1771]  
Output: 1  
Explanation: Only 1771 has an even number of digits.
