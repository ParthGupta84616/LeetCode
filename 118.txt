# Problem Description:
The code generates the first `numRows` of Pascal's Triangle. Each row of Pascal's Triangle is constructed such that each element is the sum of the two elements directly above it in the previous row.

# Algorithm:
1. Use a helper function `generateRow` to generate a specific row of Pascal's Triangle:
   - Start with the first element as `1`.
   - Use the formula `ans = ans * (row - i) / i` to compute the next element iteratively.
2. Use the `generate` function to construct the triangle:
   - For each row from `1` to `numRows`, call `generateRow` and append the result to the output.
3. Return the constructed triangle.

# Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs in O(numRows^2). Generating each row takes O(row) time, and there are `numRows` rows.

# Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses O(numRows^2) space to store the output triangle.

# Edge Cases:
1. If `numRows` is `0`, the output is an empty triangle.
2. If `numRows` is `1`, the output is `[[1]]`.

# Example:
Input: numRows = 5  
Output: [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]  

Input: numRows = 1  
Output: [[1]]
