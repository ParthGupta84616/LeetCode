# Problem Description:
The code finds the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) within an array `nums` that has the largest sum and returns that sum.

# Algorithm:
1. Use Kadane's Algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum:
   - Initialize `sum` to `0` and `max` to the smallest possible integer value.
   - Iterate through the array:
     - Add the current element to `sum`.
     - Update `max` if `sum` is greater than `max`.
     - Reset `sum` to `0` if it becomes negative, as a negative sum will not contribute to the maximum subarray.
2. Return `max` as the result.

# Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs in O(n), where `n` is the size of the array. This is because it iterates through the array once.

# Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses O(1) additional space as it only uses a few integer variables for computation.

# Edge Cases:
1. An array with a single element will return that element.
2. An array with all negative numbers will return the largest single element.
3. An array with all positive numbers will return the sum of the entire array.

# Example:
Input: nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]  
Output: 6  
Explanation: The subarray [4, -1, 2, 1] has the largest sum = 6.

Input: nums = [1]  
Output: 1  

Input: nums = [5, 4, -1, 7, 8]  
Output: 23
