# Problem Description:
The code merges two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` into a single sorted array. The merged array is stored in `nums1`, which has enough space to hold the elements of both arrays.

# Algorithm:
1. Use three pointers:
   - `i` starts at the last element of the initialized portion of `nums1`.
   - `j` starts at the last element of `nums2`.
   - `k` starts at the last position of `nums1`.
2. Compare elements from the end of both arrays:
   - Place the larger element at position `k` in `nums1` and decrement the respective pointer.
3. If any elements remain in `nums2`, copy them into `nums1`.
4. The merged array is now stored in `nums1`.

# Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs in O(m + n), where `m` is the size of `nums1` and `n` is the size of `nums2`. This is because each element is processed once.

# Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses O(1) additional space as it modifies `nums1` in-place.

# Edge Cases:
1. If `nums2` is empty, `nums1` remains unchanged.
2. If `nums1` is empty (except for the extra space), the result is `nums2`.
3. If all elements of `nums2` are smaller than the smallest element of `nums1`, they are placed at the beginning of `nums1`.

# Example:
Input: nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], m = 3, nums2 = [2, 5, 6], n = 3  
Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]  

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0  
Output: [1]  

Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1  
Output: [1]
