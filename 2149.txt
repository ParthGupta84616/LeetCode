# Problem Description:
The code rearranges an array `nums` such that positive and negative numbers alternate, starting with a positive number. The relative order of positive and negative numbers is preserved.

# Algorithm:
1. Initialize an array `ans` of the same size as `nums` with all elements set to `0`.
2. Use two pointers:
   - `positive` to track the position for the next positive number (even indices).
   - `negative` to track the position for the next negative number (odd indices).
3. Iterate through the array:
   - If the current number is positive, place it at the next available even index and increment `positive`.
   - If the current number is negative, place it at the next available odd index and increment `negative`.
4. Return the rearranged array `ans`.

# Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs in O(n), where `n` is the size of the array. This is because it iterates through the array once.

# Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses O(n) additional space for the `ans` array.

# Edge Cases:
1. An array with all positive or all negative numbers is invalid for this problem.
2. An array with alternating positive and negative numbers remains unchanged.

# Example:
Input: nums = [3, 1, -2, -5, 2, -4]  
Output: [3, -2, 1, -5, 2, -4]  

Input: nums = [-1, 1]  
Output: [1, -1]
