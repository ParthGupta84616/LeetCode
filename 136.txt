# Problem Description:
The code finds the single number in an array `nums` where every element appears twice except for one. The single number is guaranteed to appear only once.

# Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable `xorr` to `0`.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - Perform a bitwise XOR operation between `xorr` and the current element.
   - The XOR operation cancels out numbers that appear twice, leaving only the single number.
3. Return `xorr` as the single number.

# Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs in O(n), where `n` is the size of the array. This is because it iterates through the array once.

# Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses O(1) additional space as it only uses a single integer variable for computation.

# Edge Cases:
1. An array with only one element will return that element.
2. An array where all elements except one appear exactly twice.

# Example:
Input: nums = [2, 2, 1]
Output: 1

Input: nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]
Output: 4
