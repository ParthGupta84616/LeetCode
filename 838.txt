# Problem Description:
The code simulates the effect of pushing dominoes represented as a string. Each domino can be in one of three states:
- `'L'`: pushed to the left.
- `'R'`: pushed to the right.
- `'.'`: standing upright.

The goal is to determine the final state of the dominoes after all forces have been applied.

# Algorithm:
1. Use two vectors:
   - `indexes` to store the positions of non-dot characters (`'L'` or `'R'`).
   - `symbols` to store the corresponding characters.
2. Add virtual boundaries:
   - A left boundary with `'L'` at index `-1`.
   - A right boundary with `'R'` at index `N` (length of the string).
3. Iterate through pairs of consecutive non-dot characters:
   - If the characters are the same (`'L'` and `'L'` or `'R'` and `'R'`), fill the intermediate positions with the same character.
   - If the characters are `'R'` and `'L'`, fill the intermediate positions with `'R'` and `'L'` symmetrically, leaving the middle position as `'.'` if the distance is odd.
   - If the characters are `'L'` and `'R'`, leave the intermediate positions as `'.'`.
4. Return the modified string.

# Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs in O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. This is because each character is processed once.

# Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses O(n) additional space for the `indexes` and `symbols` vectors.

# Edge Cases:
1. If the string contains only `'.'`, the result is the same string.
2. If the string contains only `'L'` or `'R'`, the result is the same string.
3. If all dominoes are pushed in the same direction, the result is a string of `'L'` or `'R'`.

# Example:
Input: dominoes = "RR.L"  
Output: "RR.L"  
Explanation: The dominoes at positions 0 and 1 are pushed to the right, and the domino at position 3 is pushed to the left. No forces act on the domino at position 2.

Input: dominoes = ".L.R...LR..L.."  
Output: "LL.RR.LLRRLL.."  
Explanation: The forces propagate symmetrically, and the final state is determined accordingly.
