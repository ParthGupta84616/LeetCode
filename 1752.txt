# Problem Description:
The code checks if a given array of integers `nums` can be considered as sorted and rotated. An array is sorted and rotated if it can be obtained by taking a sorted array and rotating it some number of times.

# Algorithm:
1. Initialize a counter `bag` to track the number of times the array violates the sorted order.
2. Iterate through the array using a loop:
   - Compare each element with the next element (considering the array as circular using modulo operation).
   - If the next element is smaller than the current element, increment the `bag` counter.
   - If `bag` exceeds 1, return `false` as the array cannot be sorted and rotated.
3. If the loop completes without `bag` exceeding 1, return `true`.

# Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs in O(n), where `n` is the size of the array. This is because it iterates through the array once.

# Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses O(1) additional space as it only uses a few integer variables for computation.

# Edge Cases:
1. An empty array or an array with a single element is always considered sorted and rotated.
2. Arrays that are already sorted or fully rotated are valid.

# Example:
Input: nums = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
Output: true
Explanation: The array is sorted and rotated.

Input: nums = [2, 1, 3, 4]
Output: false
Explanation: The array is not sorted and rotated.
