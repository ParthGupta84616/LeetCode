# Problem Description:
The code finds all elements in the array `nums` that appear more than `n / 3` times, where `n` is the size of the array. The result is returned as a sorted vector.

# Algorithm:
1. Use a map to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
2. Calculate the threshold for majority elements as `n / 3 + 1`.
3. Traverse the array:
   - Increment the count of each element in the map.
   - If the count of an element reaches the threshold, add it to the result vector.
4. Sort the result vector to ensure the output is in ascending order.
5. Return the result vector.

# Time Complexity:
- The algorithm runs in O(n log k), where `n` is the size of the array and `k` is the number of unique elements. This is because inserting into the map takes O(log k) time, and sorting the result vector takes O(k log k).

# Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses O(k) additional space for the map and result vector, where `k` is the number of unique elements.

# Edge Cases:
1. If the array is empty, the result is an empty vector.
2. If no element appears more than `n / 3` times, the result is an empty vector.
3. If all elements are the same, the result contains only that element.

# Example:
Input: nums = [3, 2, 3]  
Output: [3]  

Input: nums = [1]  
Output: [1]  

Input: nums = [1, 2]  
Output: [1, 2]
