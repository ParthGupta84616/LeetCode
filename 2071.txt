# Problem Description:
The code determines the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned to workers given the constraints:
1. Each worker can complete at most one task.
2. A worker can complete a task if their strength is greater than or equal to the task's difficulty.
3. A worker can take a pill to temporarily increase their strength by `strength`.

# Algorithm:
1. Sort the `tasks` and `workers` arrays in ascending order.
2. Use binary search to determine the maximum number of tasks (`mid`) that can be assigned:
   - For each `mid`, use a deque to manage workers who can potentially complete the tasks.
   - Iterate through the tasks from largest to smallest:
     - Add workers who can complete the task with or without a pill to the deque.
     - If no worker can complete the task, return `false`.
     - Otherwise, assign the task to the most suitable worker (with or without a pill).
3. Adjust the binary search range based on whether the current `mid` is feasible.
4. Return the maximum feasible `mid`.

# Time Complexity:
- Sorting the `tasks` and `workers` arrays takes O(n log n + m log m), where `n` is the number of tasks and `m` is the number of workers.
- The binary search runs in O(log(min(n, m))) iterations, and each iteration processes up to O(n + m) elements.
- Overall complexity: O((n + m) log(n + m)).

# Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses O(m) additional space for the deque.

# Edge Cases:
1. If there are no tasks or no workers, the result is `0`.
2. If all tasks are easier than the weakest worker's strength, all tasks can be assigned.
3. If all tasks are harder than the strongest worker's strength (even with a pill), no tasks can be assigned.

# Example:
Input: tasks = [3, 2, 1], workers = [0, 3, 3], pills = 1, strength = 1  
Output: 3  
Explanation: Assign tasks [1, 2, 3] to workers [3, 3, 0] with one pill.

Input: tasks = [5, 4], workers = [0, 0, 0], pills = 2, strength = 5  
Output: 2  
Explanation: Use pills to assign both tasks.
